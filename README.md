# Blensor

A fork of the BlenSor repository. In this repo I'm expanding the the VLP-16 sensor simulation capabilities for use in my Master thesis project. See https://github.uio.no/branisj/thesis for the main repository.

The scanning code can be found in the [blendodyne.py](tree/branislav-thesis/release/scripts/addons/blensor/blendodyne.py) file.
