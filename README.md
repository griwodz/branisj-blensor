# Blensor

A fork of the BlenSor repository. In this repo the VLP-16 sensor simulation capabilities are extended to simulate a more realistic noise for LiDAR scans.

The scanning code can be found in the [blendodyne.py](release/scripts/addons/blensor/blendodyne.py) file. 

For build instructions, follow the BlenSor build instructions available at the [blender Website](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender).
